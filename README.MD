# Example Agent for TotalAgility
This project provides an example TotalAgility package containing a template for a managing or planning agent, which in turn can call other worker or micro agents, as required, to complete its goal.

The agent desgin makes use of standardised input and output interfaces for Agent or Custom LLM type processes, meaning the managing agent can call any worker agent without needing to know specific details of how each worker agent is implemented.

 [![Example Managing Agent Pattern](./images/Example%20Managing%20Agent%20Pattern.png)]

The pattern uses a registry of available worker agents, which are used in the planning step of the managing agent to describe the capabilities of each worker agent. 

This overall pattern is similar to "tool use" via MCP, and indeed the managing agent or worker agents can be called via an MCP Proxy using TotalAgility's OpenAPI REST interface. 

The package was created using TotalAgility 8.1.0.

## Package & Repo Contents
The following items details the contents of the TotalAgility package and associated repo.

### Categories
This package creates a category called ```Example Agent``` accessible to everyone. 

### Data Models
3 data models are used in the Example Agent. This are configured as "local" Data Models inside the process itself but could also be used as global models if desired. 

 - ```Intent and Next Action Data Model.json``` this model is used to contain routing data to trigger the next step, as decided by the _Identify Intent & Next Action Planning_ step in the _Example Managing Agent Pattern_. 
 - ```Reflection Data Model.json```
 - ```Tool Registry Data Model.json```

The json templates to create these models are provided in the repo under ```data models```.

### Global Variables


### Forms


### Processes


### Utility Processes
These are synchronous processes, that provide utility functions. Included in the project are:
 - Util Trim HTML
 - Util Trim Json 

 These run scripts to trim wrapping markdown formatting from LLM generated HTML or Json respectively. 


### Integrations 


### Scripts
The project makes use of 2 script based processes that strip MD formatting from json or html data generated by Generative AI Activity steps in TotalAgility processes. The MD syntax is present due to system prompts used by the Generative AI Activity in TotalAgility. 

An alternative approach is to output from the Generative AI Activity into a Data Model, but in testing this approach provided less control over the exact output than prompting and outputing to a string. 

The scipts for these processes are included in the scripts folder of the repo.
